- **[Provisioners](../platform/provisioners.mdx)**— Machinery for securely automating certificate issuance
- **[Inventories](../platform/inventories.mdx)**— Catalogs of entities like hosts, services, and people for use with templates and provisioners
- **[Templates](../platform/templates.mdx)**— Customization of x.509 or SSH certificates for any use case
- **[Events](../platform/events.mdx)**— Observability and alerting for certificate lifecycle activities
