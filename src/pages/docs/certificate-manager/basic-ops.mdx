In this documentation, we will explore basic certificate operations using the step command-line tool. step acts as a front-end interface to certificate manager and is used for many common crypto and X.509 operations. This tutorial covers:

Creating a certificate
Inspecting a certificate
Renewing a certificate
Revoking a certificate
See Smallstep certificate Manager in action. Watch the how to issue your first certificate video.
Before you begin.
This tutorial assumes you have created a Smallstep Team and a Certificate Manager Authority using the steps in Getting Started.

step 1 - Create a test certificate
With an Authority created and your local client configured, you can create a test certificate by running the step ca certificate command. Here is an example:

{`$ step ca certificate myservice myservice.crt myservice.key --san myservice.internal.mycompany.net --not-after 24h`}
In this command, we are asking the CA to create a certificate with the following properties

myservice - The name on the certificate
myservice.crt - Store the certificate in a file with this name
myservice.key - Store the key in a file with this name
--san myservice.internal.mycompany.net - Add an additional SAN to the certificate with the specified value
--not-after 24h - Set the certificate to expire after 24 hours.
When you run this command, it will envoke the 'authority-admin' provisioner and start a single sign-on flow via the smallstep dashboard. After a successful sign-in, the authority will issue the certificate.

Step 2 - Inspect a test certificate
You can inspect your certificate by running:

{`$ step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt`}
It should look similar to this.

X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2441...2018]
  Subject:     myservice
               admin@yourco.com
               https://auth.smallstep.com#98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda
  Issuer:      Dev Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: authority-admin [ID: 909d...8521]
  Valid from:  2021-10-04T21:30:12Z
          to:  2021-10-05T21:31:12Z
step 3 - renew a certificate
Certificates expire. Certificate Manager makes renewing a certificate ahead of expiration easy. Renewals are authenticated using your existing certificate and produce an identical certificate with a new serial number and extended lifetime. The private key is unchanged.

In its most primitive form, renewal is a simple single-command operation:

{`$ step ca renew myservice.crt myservice.key`}
More than a dozen command-line flags make step ca renewflexible and easy to integrate into almost any operational environment.

Inspect your certificate again, and you will see it has an extended lifetime.

{`$ step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2441...2018] Subject: myservice admin@yourco.com https://auth.smallstep.com#98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda Issuer: Dev Intermediate CA Provisioner: authority-admin [ID: 909d...8521] Valid from: 2021-10-04T21:32:34Z to: 2021-10-05T21:33:34Z`}

step 4 - revoke a certificate
Certificate Manager uses passive revocation by default. To passively revoke a certificate means to block its renewal at the CA. This eliminates the additional network request that occurs when using active revocation because the certificate expires by itself. With passive revocation certificates cannot be immediately revoked. Therefore, certificates should have a shorter lifetime to reduce the value of a key that has been exfiltrated. To revoke a certificate, run the following operation.

{`$ step ca revoke --cert=myservice.crt --key=myservice.key âœ” CA: https://your.authority.ca.smallstep.com Certificate with Serial Number 215963883671773554731824269659406308792 has been revoked.`}
Upon expiry, this certificate will no longer be valid. If you try to renew the certificate, it will fail.

{`$ step ca renew myservice.crt myservice.key error renewing certificate: The request lacked necessary authorization to be completed. Please see the certificate authority logs for more info.`}
Passive revocation doesn't use Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Signing Protocol (OCSP) like Web PKI. Certificate Manager support for CRL and OCSP is coming soon.
