TLS is the cryptographic protocol that powers encryption for many network applications. And for Kubernetes TLS, you need certificates. TLS certificates are fundamental to standing up a Kubernetes cluster and for interacting with/within the cluster. Given this reliance on certificates, we are often asked for advice on how to *“do certificates in Kubernetes”.* 

It turns out there are lots of things that Kubernetes TLS can mean. Here’s a hit list of some of the places where you can use certificates:

- Ingresses / ingress controllers
- Containers (the application in a container needs a cert)
- Service mesh
- `[kubernetes.io/tls](http://kubernetes.io/tls)` secrets
- The Kubernetes datastore (eg. `etcd`)
- Kubernetes Nodes & other components
- Admission Controllers
- Users & Kubernetes API Server connections

At Smallstep, we’ve thought deeply about these cases and have created this document to help you navigate what can be a complex journey to secure Kubernetes. 

### It all starts with a question about what are you looking to achieve.

1. I want to connect things outside Kubernetes to things inside Kubernetes. 
2. I want to get a cert for the service running in a container or pod.
3. I am installing Kubernetes and need certs to secure things.
