<p>
  Once {props.pzt.name} TLS is configured with cert-manager, all workloads and
  services deployed within the mesh will automitacally have certificates signed
  and renewed by the <inlineCode>step</inlineCode> CA. You will not have to
  distribute the certificate manually.

Istio mutual TLS has a permissive mode, which allows a service to accept both plaintext traffic and mutual TLS traffic at the same time.
This feature greatly improves the mutual TLS onboarding experience.
But once onboarding is complete, we recommend switching the mode to strict.
The following peer authentication policy requires all workloads in namespace `smallstep` to use mutual TLS:

<CodeBlock autoCopy language="yaml">
  {`apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: "example-policy"
  namespace: "smallstep"
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT`}
</CodeBlock>

On our blog, we've written an [in-depth post on Istio and Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/blog/istio-with-private-ca/#bookinfo-application).
Follow the Bookinfo demo application steps to test everything we've accomplished above.
