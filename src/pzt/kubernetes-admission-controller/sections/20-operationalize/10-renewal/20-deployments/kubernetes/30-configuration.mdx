Telling your `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` or `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` to make use of the certificate and private key
in the `myserver-tls` secret is as easy as adding a CA Injector annotation
to your exsting webhook resources. Notice that we can obmit the `caBundle` in the `clientConfig` because of the new `inject-ca-from` annotation.

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: smallstep-mutating-webhooks
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from: myserver-tls
...
webhooks:
- name: my-webhook.example.com
  clientConfig:
    service:
      namespace: my-service-namespace
      name: my-service-name
      path: /my-path
      port: 1234
  ...
```

Voila! Your webhooks will pick up this `tls` configuration
and automatically serve the renewed certificate each time
the `myserver-tls` secret is updated.
