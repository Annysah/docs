- [Client verification of server certificates](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBQ-SSL-CERTIFICATES)
  Use the `sslrootcert` config parameter to change the location of the root CA bundle. By default, psql will look in `~/.postgresql/root.crt`.
  Use `sslmode=verify-full` to check both the server certificate CA chain, and that the certificate common name matches the server hostname.

- Here's an example of a `pg_hba.conf` that will configure PostgreSQL to require TLS for all non-local connections:
  
  ```
  # TYPE     DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS              METHOD
  local      all             all                                  trust
  hostssl    all             all             localhost            scram-sha-256
  hostssl    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            scram-sha-256
  
  # Or, use client certificates with a CN set to the username
  #
  # TYPE     DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS              METHOD
  hostssl    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            cert
  ```
