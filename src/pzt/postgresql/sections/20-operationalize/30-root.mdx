Once PostgreSQL server TLS is enforced,
you'll need to make sure that remote clients will verify and trust certificates signed by your CA.

The `psql` CLI client will not read CA certificates from the system trust store
such as the macOS Keychain.
It needs to be [explicitly configured](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBQ-SSL-CERTIFICATES) to trust your CA,
and to verify the server's certificate (using `sslmode=verify-full`).

The `psql` client looks for CA certificates in the `~/.postgresql/root.crt` file in the user's home directory.
