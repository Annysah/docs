Once MySQL server TLS is enforced,
you'll need to make sure that remote clients will verify and trust certificates signed by your CA.

The `mysql` CLI client will not read CA certificates from the system trust store
(such as the macOS Keychain).
It needs to be [explicitly configured](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/using-encrypted-connections.html) to trust your CA (using `--ssl-ca=ca.pem`),
and to verify the server's certificate (using `--ssl-mode=CA_VERIFY`).

- The `mysql` client requires the `ca.pem` to contain both the CA root and intermediate certificates.
- Some [Connectors and APIs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connectors-apis.html) will accept [connection option files](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html), just as the `mysql` client does.

Most teams will use some form of automation
to distribute the root certificate bundle to client applications.
Depending on your needs and your IT or DevOps team's approach, this may be
a configuration management tool (like Ansible or Puppet),
a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution,
or something else. Some examples:

- Use Ansible to add a `ca.pem` directly to linux VMs so running applications trust the API servers they call
- Bake `ca.pem` directly into base Docker images for gRPC so gRPC clients can always reference the trusted CA
- Store `ca.pem` in a Kubernetes `Secret` and inject it into an environment variable for access from application code
- Store `ca.pem` in a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` and mount it to pods for reference on the filesystem
