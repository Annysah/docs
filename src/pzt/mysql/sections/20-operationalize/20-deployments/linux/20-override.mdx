To renew and hot-reload the MySQL server certificate,
we will need a MySQL-specific systemd override file that can tell MySQL to refresh its certificates.
To install the override, run:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/cert-renewer@mysql.service.d
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cert-renewer@mysql.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
; "Environment=" overrides are applied per environment variable. This line does not
; affect any other variables set in the service template.
Environment=CERT_LOCATION=/var/lib/mysql/server-cert.pem \\
            KEY_LOCATION=/var/lib/mysql/server-key.pem

LoadCredential=reloader@localhost.cnf:/var/lib/mysql/reloader@localhost.cnf

; Empty ExecStartPost (Don't attempt to restart mysql.service)
ExecStartPost=
ExecStartPost=mysql --defaults-extra-file="\$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY/reloader@localhost.cnf" \\
                  -e "ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS"
EOF
```

You'll need a database user (eg. `reloader@localhost`) that has the [`CONNECTION_ADMIN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_connection-admin) privilege, for reloading the certificate:

```
mysql> CREATE USER 'reloader'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

mysql> GRANT CONNECTION_ADMIN on *.* to 'reloader'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

```

Replace `password` with a secure password.
Finally, create the `reloader@localhost.cnf` credential file for the mysql client,
which will look like:

```ini
[client]
password="password"
```

When the certificate is renewed,
the renewal service will use the Unix domain socket to connect as `reloader@localhost`.
TLS will not be enabled for that connection, because it is already considered secure.
That's good because we want our certificate renewer to reach the server even if the server certificate is expired.
