When working with certificate in containers, you'll need to decide how and where and when to handle each of these tasks:

- **Root distribution**: Getting the container to trust the CA
- **Enrollment**: Issuing the service a new TLS certificate from the CA
- **Renewal**: Renewing the certificate when it nears expiry
- **Deployment**: Moving the certificate into place and signaling a certificate reload

There are several approaches one could take for full certificate automation. Here are a few:

- **Self-contained**:
  With this approach, the official Docker image for the service is augmented to add certificate management functions, usually by overriding the `ENTRYPOINT`.
  CA trust is bootstrapped when the image is built, and the root CA certificate is baked into the image.
- **Host-based**:
  The host is responsible for renewing certificates for containerized services,
  and for triggering a reload of certificate files (or restarting the containers) when certificates are renewed.
  Certificates can be shared from the host via volume mounts, or copied into the container.
  This approach can leverage a systemd-based certificate renewal timer (see the Linux tab for details).
- **Multi-container**:
  Certificates are mounted via shared volume mounts,
  and a separate container is responsible for certificate enrollment, renewal, and deployment.
  Deployment can happen via an API call directly to the service, if it supports online certificate reloading via API.

For an in-depth exploration of these approaches, with examples and tradeoffs, see our blog post [Automating TLS Certificate Management in Docker](https://smallstep.com/blog/automate-docker-ssl-tls-certificates/).

To support the broadest range of environments where containers are run,
**we prefer the self-contained approach**.
While it requires building a custom Docker image,
it solves the problems of root distribution, enrollment, renewal, and deployment
without requiring volume mounts or changes to the host environment.
