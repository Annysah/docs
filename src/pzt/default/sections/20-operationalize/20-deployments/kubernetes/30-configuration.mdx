  Now that your certificate is issued (and kept updated) in the{' '}
  <inlineCode>{props.pzt.server.name}-tls</inlineCode> secret, you'll need to
  configure your {props.pzt.name} deployment to mount that secret to disk, then
  to reload the certificate (or restart its process) each time the certificate
  is updated on disk.
  A general approach to certificate reloading and secret rotation in Kubernetes is to
  use{' '}<a href="https://github.com/stakater/Reloader">Reloader</a>{' '}
  or a similar tool to watch the{' '}<inlineCode>{props.pzt.server.name}-tls</inlineCode> secret,
  and run a rolling upgrade of your deployment when it changes.
