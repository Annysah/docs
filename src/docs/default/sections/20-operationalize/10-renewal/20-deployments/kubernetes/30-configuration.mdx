      Now that your certificate is issued (and kept updated) in the <inlineCode>
        tls-{server.name}
      </inlineCode> secret, you'll need to configure your {name} deployment to mount
      that secret to disk, then to reload the certificate (or restart its process)
      each time the certificate is updated on disk. We haven't yet investigated the specifics for {name}.
      Refer to the {name} documentation for more details, and feel free to{' '}
