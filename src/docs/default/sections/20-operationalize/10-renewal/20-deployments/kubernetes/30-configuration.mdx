      Now that your certificate is issued (and kept updated) in the <inlineCode>
        {server.name}-tls
      </inlineCode> secret, you'll need to configure your {name} deployment to mount
      that secret to disk, then to reload the certificate (or restart its process)
      each time the certificate is updated on disk. Refer to the {name} documentation
      for specifics.
