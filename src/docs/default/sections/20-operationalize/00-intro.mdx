In the Try It section above you manually created a Redis TLS certificate.
If you are comfortable manually creating the first Redis TLS certificate for your servers you can skip to the configuring automated renewal section below.

For automating certificate issuance, smallstep provides several methods called [Provisioners](https://smallstep.com/docs/platform/provisioners).
You can use a secret, one-time token, ACME challenge, and other programmatic approaches.
Given its popularity,
we have provided instructions for using the ACME Protocol to automate certificate issuance and renewal
as part of this tutorial.
If you want to use ACME,
be sure to [configure your Certificate Manager authority for ACME support](https://smallstep.com/docs/certificate-manager/acme)
before continuing on to the automated renewal section.
