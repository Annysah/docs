<p>
  Before you can teach <DocConfig>{({ name }) => name}</DocConfig> to speak TLS,
  you will need a certificate issued by a trusted CA. If your organization
  already runs its own CA and you have a private key and certificate for your{' '}
  <DocConfig>{({ name }) => name}</DocConfig> server&mdash;along with your CA's
  root certificate&mdash;you can skip to the{' '}
  <DocConfig>{({ name }) => name}</DocConfig> server configuration below. If
  your organization does not yet run its own private CA, you can:

</ul>

<Alert severity="warning">
  If you prefer to use public Web TLS/SSL certificates, you can get those
  certificates from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> using
  the ACME instructions below. However, keep in mind that if you are deploying
  internal websites, it may still be a good idea to use a private CA to keep
  your certificates out of public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and to
  allow for more flexible certificate issuance without the need to resolve
  public DNS.
</Alert>

<p>
  To request a certificate from your CA using the{' '}
  <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli">
    <inlineCode>step</inlineCode>
  </a>{' '}
  CLI, bootstrap your CA with <inlineCode>step ca bootstrap</inlineCode> and run
  the following command (sub the server name for the actual name / DNS name of
  your <DocConfig>{({ name }) => name}</DocConfig> server).
</p>

<MDXBlock path="snippets/certificate" />

Your certificate and private key will be saved in `server.crt` and `server.key` respectively.

Request a copy of your CA root certificate, which will be used to make
sure each application can trust certificates presented by other
applications.

```shell
step ca root ca.crt
```

Your certificate will be saved in `ca.crt`.
