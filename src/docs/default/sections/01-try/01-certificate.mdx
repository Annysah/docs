<p>
  Before you can teach <DocConfig>{({ name }) => name}</DocConfig> to
  speak TLS, you will need a certificate issued by a trusted
  certificate authority (CA). If your organization already runs its
  own CA and you have a private key and certificate for your{' '}
  <DocConfig>{({ name }) => name}</DocConfig> server, along with your
  CA's root certificate, you can skip to the next step.

<p>
  To request a certificate from your CA using the
  <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli"><inlineCode>step</inlineCode></a>{' '}
  CLI, bootstrap your CA with <inlineCode>step ca bootstrap</inlineCode> and run the
  following command (sub the server name for the actual name / DNS name of your{' '}
  <DocConfig>{({ name }) => name}</DocConfig> server).

Your certificate and private key will be saved in `server.crt` and `server.key` respectively.

Request a copy of your CA root certificate, which will be used to make
sure each application can trust certificates presented by other
applications.

```shell
step ca root ca.crt
```

Your certificate will be saved in `ca.crt`.
