You may have noticed that certificates issued by a Smallstep CA
follow best practices and have very short lifetimes.
In fact, our default is just a single day.
So, what should you do tomorrow or the next day
when your certificate is no longer valid?

The answer to that question exposes
why so many TLS certificates in the wild still use long-lived lifetimes
despite their poor security characteristics:
people are manually renewing them,
and this doesn't scale with short lifetimes.

To solve this problem, we will automate certificate renewal.
Smallstep CAs offer a variety of mechanisms (called _provisioners_)
to automate certificate renewal.
The simplest generic password-based mechanism is covered below.
However, if you have the time to invest in setting up your infrastructure,
you can also rely on ACME, the standard protocol designed
by ISRG (Let's Encrypt) specifically for TLS certificate renewal.
Both approaches are covered here in detail.
