You'll also notice the above `Certificate` resource has an `issuerRef` specifying
a cert-manager `StepIssuer` resource named `my-ca`. Before cert-manager knows how to use your CA to
issue and renew your certificate, we'll need to create and configure that `Issuer` resource
to point to your private CA. Create `my-ca-issuer.yaml` and fill in the CA
URL with your own. Also, makes sure the secret reference matches the name you used in the certificate
resource.

<DocConfig>
  {({ server, kubernetes }) => (
    <CodeBlock autoCopy language="yaml">
      {`# TODO StepIssuer resource and some prose about where to get JWK details`}
    </CodeBlock>
  )}
</DocConfig>

Then apply:

```shell
kubectl apply -f my-ca-issuer.yaml
```

<DocConfig>
  {({ name, server }) => (
    <p>
      If all went as expected now that both your{' '}
      <inlineCode>Certificate</inlineCode> and your{' '}
      <inlineCode>StepIssuer</inlineCode> are configured, cert-manager should
      have reached out to your Smallstep CA, issued (or begun issuing) the
      certificate, and created the <inlineCode>tls-{server.name}</inlineCode>{' '}
      secret with your certificate and private key. We'll reference this secret
      later when we configure {name} to use this certificate and private key for
      TLS.
    </p>
  )}
