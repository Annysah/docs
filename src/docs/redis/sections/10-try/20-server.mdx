You can test your certificate by starting up Redis with TLS enabled.


<Alert severity="warning">
  Native "SSL Support" (TLS) was added to Redis 6.0.0, which was released GA on April 30, 2020.
  TLS in Redis is an <strong>optional feature</strong> and not all Redis server binaries will have it enabled.
  The official Docker image, and many OS distribution images, have TLS enabled.
</Alert>


```shell
redis-server \
	--tls-port 6379 --port 0 \
	--tls-cert-file /path/to/server.crt \
	--tls-key-file /path/to/server.key \
	--tls-ca-cert-file /path/to/ca.crt \
	--tls-auth-clients no
```
