Even that `step-ca` supports to grant certificates using ACME to hostnames like
`localhost`, `acme/autocert` requires domains with at least a dot (`.`) in it.

You might have noticed that in the kubernetes example we're not using the
built-in ACME binary. It works also in Kuberentes, but you won't be able to
scale it to use multiple pods because the ACME flow requires to know a previous
state, and our examples and `acme/autocert` are stateless.
